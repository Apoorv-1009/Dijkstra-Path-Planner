# Path Planning using Dijkstra's Algorithm
![dijkstra test](https://github.com/Apoorv-1009/Dijkstra-Path-Planner/assets/57452076/8a073705-1386-4b3e-96f8-0a01d01cb6e4)

This code demonstrates path planning using Dijkstra's algorithm in a 2D grid environment. The algorithm finds the shortest path from a start node to a goal node while avoiding obstacles.

## How to provide inputs

1. Follow the prompts to enter the start and goal coordinates.
2. If the start/goal happens to be in the obstacle space, then the user will be repromted to enter the start/goal till it is not in the obstacle space
6. The script will visualize the path planning process and display the result.

## Libraries/Dependencies Used

- NumPy: For numerical computations and array manipulation.
- OpenCV (cv2): For image processing tasks such as drawing and displaying images.
- heapq: Provides functions for heap queue operations (used for priority queue implementation in Dijkstra's algorithm).

## Description

1. **Action Cost Set Definition:** Defines the cost of each action (movement) in the grid.

2. **Mathematical Representation of Free Space:** Defines the canvas and obstacles in the grid environment. Obstacles are represented by filled polygons.

3. **Generate the Graph and Check for Goal Node:** Implements Dijkstra's algorithm to search for the optimal path from the start node to the goal node while avoiding obstacles.

4. **Optimal Path Generation:** Retrieves the optimal path from the parent dictionary generated by Dijkstra's algorithm.

5. **Represent the Optimal Path:** Visualizes the start and goal nodes, visited nodes, and the optimal path on the canvas. This visualization is performed in an animated manner, showing the progression of the algorithm.

## Note
- The script generates an output video (`dijkstra.mp4`) showing the progression of the algorithm and the final result.
